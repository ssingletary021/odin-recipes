    <h1>Ground Beef Stroganoff Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Beef Stroganoff has graced the tables of many over the centuries. But, who
      can take credit for this lusciously creamy, beefy dish? Authentic Beef
      Stroganoff was dreamt up in Russia in the early 1800s by the personal chef
      of Count Stroganoff, a dignitary in the court of Alexander III at the
      time. The chef then named his creation after the Count and the rest is
      history.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 lb lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 lb mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
      <li>1 cup whipping cream</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt, adjust to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper, adjust to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat a heavy, deep pan over medium-high heat with olive oil. Add
        ground beef and stir to break down beef into tiny pieces. Add onions and
        minced garlic. Saute until the onion is translucent and golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sliced mushrooms and saute for another 5 minutes or until the
        mushrooms soften. If they release a lot of juice, let it evaporate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour and stir until fully incorporated. Be sure to mix in any lumps
        that form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 cup beef broth, 1 cup whipping cream, 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce,
        1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper and bring it to a simmer. Turn
        the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and add in sour cream. Stir to combine everything
        together and season to taste if needed. Serve over noodles, rice or
        potatoes.
